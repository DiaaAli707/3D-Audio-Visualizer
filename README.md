# 3D-Audio-Visualizer
* Application visualizes the amplitude of different sounds within a soundtrack in 3D

* Utilizes a 3D sphere and rectangles to create the visualizer:

     o Length of rectangles corresponds to various amplitude inputs (different rectangles would have different length, they don't all share the same amplitude)
